‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
LaunchPad AI provides a simple user interface where you can input a description of your startup idea.

The user enters their idea and clicks "Generate".

The Next.js frontend sends a POST request to a dedicated API route (/api/generate-website).

This API route securely communicates with the Gemini API, sending a detailed and structured prompt.

The AI model processes the prompt and returns a complete, single-file HTML document.

The API route sends the generated HTML back to the frontend.

The frontend displays the HTML in an iframe for a live preview and in a code block for inspection.
